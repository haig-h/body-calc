/*
in initialInputs instead of what i have i can do this instead
public void readAandB(){
        //You can use scanner to init your values
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a :");
        a = scan.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter b :");
        b = scan.nextInt();
    }
from - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41075769/using-variables-of-one-class-in-another-class-java
